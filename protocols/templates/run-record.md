## Randomness

Record master seed, per-task seed derivation, generator implementation, worker
count, and task ordering.

## Resources

| Resource | Planned | Observed |
|---|---:|---:|
| Wall time | | |
| Peak memory | | |
| Storage written | | |

## Outputs

## Diagnostics

Record convergence, movement from starts, objective values, warnings, retries,
boundary behavior, and residual checks.

## Deviations

List every protocol deviation. If none, state `None`. Undocumented deviations
invalidate result-bearing execution.

## Disposition

State whether the run may proceed to gate review and which artifacts are
authoritative, diagnostic, invalid, or quarantined.
